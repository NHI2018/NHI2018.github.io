    	<h3>Universal Health Care, Equity, <l>and</l> Governance: Taiwan <l>in</l> International Perspective</h3>
      <p><em>All themes are focused on the national health insurance (NHI) systems in five nations: Taiwan, Japan, S. Korea, Canada, and Chile.  But our last panel will expand the comparison to other countries.</em></p>
      <hr>

        <h4>Theme 1: History <l>of</l> National Health Insurance</h4>
        <div class="theme-image banner">
        	<img src="images/tommy-douglas.jpg" alt="" />
        	<em>http://www.canadashistory.ca/Explore/Politics-Law/History-Idol-Tommy-Douglas</em>
        </div>
        <p>The conference explores the history of the national health insurance (NHI) systems in Taiwan, Japan, S. Korea, Canada, and Chile. Specific focuses are on the origins of the NHI system, the motivations behind the leadership’s commitment to universal health care, the construction of the NHI system as a political process, the key players involved, and the ethical foundation on which the NHI system rests. Conference participants will also examine how these NHI systems have generated changes and reforms since their inception in the aforementioned countries. </p>

        <h4>Theme 2: Equity <l>in</l> Health, Access <l>to</l> Healthcare, <l>and</l> Financial Burden <l>under</l> NHI</h4>
        <div class="theme-image image-right">
        	<img src="images/health-equity.gif" alt="" />
        	<em>http://www.who.int/features/2017/health-equity/en/</em>
        </div>
        <p>The conference analyzes equity in health, access to healthcare, healthcare utilization, and financial burden of healthcare under these five national health systems. Invited speakers will reflect on relevant equity principles incorporated in each of the NHI system, and distributive justice principles applied in empirical analysis of various dimensions of equity. Furthermore, we will also discuss challenges that the NHI system has to face in the formulation of policies targeting the issue of equity.</p>

        <h4>Theme 3: Governance <l>of</l> NHI</h4>
        <div class="theme-image image-left">
        	<img src="images/taiwan-nhi-01.png" alt="" />
        	<em>https://cnews.com.tw/120171113-3/</em>
        </div>
        <p>Governance has emerged as one of the leading and essential issues in all universal healthcare systems, an issue which is not yet seriously tackled and studied by citizens who live in  countries without such systems (such as the USA).  In dissecting the theme of governance, conference participants will delve into how and in what form each nation incorporates citizen participation in key decision-making processes (such as setting the goals/objectives of the system, priority setting in coverage, and distribution of financial burden).  We will also discuss a variety of systems of governance that various societies have implemented or considered.</p>

        <h4>Theme 4: International Comparison <l>of</l> NHI: Taiwan, Japan, South  Korea, Canada, <l>and</l> Chile</h4>

        </div>
        <p>From an international perspective, we will investigate the topic of international comparison of national health systems, especially the national health insurance (NHI) systems. Special focus will be given to the following questions:</p>
        <ol>
          <li>What is the purpose of comparison?</li>
          <li>What are the bases for comparison?</li>
          <li>What criteria of comparison are likely to be universal, and what criteria are likely to be contextual?</li>
          <li>To what extend and how can one nation learn from another nation’s health system?</li>
        </ol>
        <p>While our discussion will be focused on Taiwan, Japan, S. Korea, Canada, and Chile, the implications of the comparisons could be applicable to other nations.</p>

    	<h3>The Chiu Program <l>for</l> Taiwan Studies</h3>
    	<h5>School of History, Philosophy and Religion</h5>
    	<p>Based on the generous support from the Chun and Jane Chiu Family Foundation, the Chiu Program for Taiwan Studies is dedicated to the promotion of interdisciplinary knowledge and research about Taiwan. By sponsoring sophisticated and cutting-edge comparative and transnational research on Taiwan, we hope to uncover experiences, challenges, and prospects grounded in Taiwan’s unique  conditions. The program is oriented to both OSU faculty and the international community of Taiwan Studies. In recent years, we have provided funds for international exchange, supported postdoctoral research, and coordinated research conferences. We also value partnerships and collaboration, looking forward to work with colleagues and institutions to expand the presence of Taiwan studies in various disciplines.</p>
