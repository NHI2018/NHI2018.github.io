    	<h3>Universal Health Care, Equity, <l>and</l> Governance: Taiwan <l>in</l> International Perspective</h3>
      <p><em>All themes are focused on the national health insurance (NHI) systems in five nations: Taiwan, Japan, S. Korea, Canada, and Chile.  But our last panel will expand the comparison to other countries.</em></p>

        <h4>Theme 1: History <l>of</l> National Health Insurance</h4>
        <div class="theme-image banner">

        	<em>http://www.canadashistory.ca/Explore/Politics-Law/History-Idol-Tommy-Douglas</em>
        </div>
        <p>The conference explores the history of the national health insurance (NHI) systems in Taiwan, Japan, S. Korea, Canada, and Chile. Specific focuses are on the origins of the NHI system, the motivations behind the leadership’s commitment to universal health care, the construction of the NHI system as a political process, the key players involved, and the ethical foundation on which the NHI system rests. Conference participants will also examine how these NHI systems have generated changes and reforms since their inception in the aforementioned countries. </p>

        <h4>Theme 2: Equity <l>in</l> Health, Access <l>to</l> Healthcare, <l>and</l> Financial Burden <l>under</l> NHI</h4>

        </div>
        <p>According to WHO, health is a fundamental human right. Health disparities in the provision of health care have caused diseases, suffering, and premature deaths. Health inequities have also increased health expenditures and reduced economic productivity. The conference analyzes equity in health, access to healthcare, healthcare utilization, and financial burden of healthcare under these five national health systems. Invited speakers will reflect on relevant equity principles incorporated in each of the NHI system, and distributive justice principles applied in empirical analysis of various dimensions of equity. Furthermore, we will also discuss challenges that the NHI system has to face in the formulation of policies targeting the issue of equity.</p>

        <h4>Keynote Speech: Universal Health Care - The Challenge <l>of</l> <l>the</l> Next Century</h4>
        <div class="theme-image image-left">
          <img src="images/rudolf-virchow.jpg" alt="" />

        </div>
        <p>"Politics is... medicine on a large scale," said the great German pathologist Rudolf Virchow. The development of universal health insurance systems in most advanced countries has illustrated his insight.  But this political achievement has highlighted the limitations of clinical medicine and led to a renewed appreciation of "the social determinants of health" - the conditions in which people live and work. We are now in a third phase, in which the health consequences of a deteriorating physical environment are emerging. The political challenges are immense, and human survival is at risk.</p>

        <h4>Theme 3: Governance <l>of</l> NHI</h4>
        <div class="theme-image image-right">
        	<img src="images/taiwan-nhi-01.png" alt="" />
        	<em>https://cnews.com.tw/120171113-3/</em>
        </div>
        <p>Governance has emerged as one of the leading and essential issues in all universal healthcare systems, an issue which is not yet seriously tackled and studied by citizens who live in  countries without such systems (such as the USA).  In dissecting the theme of governance, conference participants will delve into how and in what form each nation incorporates citizen participation in key decision-making processes (such as setting the goals/objectives of the system, priority setting in coverage, and distribution of financial burden).  We will also discuss a variety of systems of governance that various societies have implemented or considered.</p>

        </div>
        <p>From an international perspective, we will investigate the topic of international comparison of national health systems, especially the national health insurance (NHI) systems. Special focus will be given to the following questions:</p>
        <ol>
          <li>What is the purpose of comparison?</li>
          <li>What are the bases for comparison?</li>
          <li>What criteria of comparison are likely to be universal, and what criteria are likely to be contextual?</li>
          <li>To what extent and how can one nation learn from another nation’s health system?</li>
        </ol>
        <p>While our discussion will be focused on Taiwan, Japan, S. Korea, Canada, and Chile, the implications of the comparisons could be applicable to other nations.</p>

        	<h3>Robert G. Evans <span>- University of British Columba</h3></span>
        	<img src="images/robert-evans.jpg" alt="">
          <p>After completing an honors BA in Political Science and Economics at the University of Toronto and a Ph.D. at Harvard, Bob Evans joined the Department of Economics at UBC in 1969. He retired in 2010. Earlier work at the Dominion Bureau of Statistics (now Statistics Canada) on National Income Accounting left significant traces on his subsequent understanding and representation of the economic behavior of health care systems; work at the Bank of Canada on large-scale econometric modeling of the Canadian economy did not.</p>
          <p>The most significant early influences, however, were extended conversations with Susanne Evans who was nursing at the Massachusetts General Hospital during the time at Harvard. It became evident that the complex models of economic behavior presented in advanced economic theory had little or no connection with the actual institutions and incentive structures in this large and rapidly-expanding sector of the modern economy.  Indeed the whole organization, delivery, and financing of health care make little sense from the perspective of mainstream or “textbook” economic theory. Conversely, traditional economic theory, with its informed, utility-maximizing consumers and profit-seeking privately-owned firms competing freely on the basis of relative prices, is on some other planet. Analyses, critiques and policy prescriptions derived from that traditional framework of understanding tend therefore to generate wrong predictions and bad policy advice. They are largely and rightly ignored, in all countries, by those responsible for delivering, financing, or administering health care.</p>
          <p>And yet the structure and functioning of health care systems in the real world are very far from ideal. The massive health care system of the United States is universally acknowledged to generate inefficiencies, inequities, and sheer bureaucratic waste on an equally massive scale. But similar issues arise, albeit in much less extreme forms, in other advanced countries. The attempt to understand this discrepancy between standard economic theory and health care reality, and to construct a more realistic economic framework, more useful as a guide for public policy, has been at the core of Evans’ career research program.</p>
          <p>That effort turned out to rest heavily on the explicit recognition of the concept of health -- conspicuously absent from standard economic models. This, in turn, led to the question of the broader determinants of health, outside or alongside the health care system. From 1987 to 1997 Professor Evans served as the (Founding) Director of the Program in Population Health within the Canadian Institute of Advanced Research. This was a multi-disciplinary team of distinguished researchers, selected both for their expertise and for their aptitude for co-operative, innovative cross-disciplinary work. This group has had a significant impact on the current understanding of the impact of the social environment on health, including but going well beyond that of the health care system.</p>
          <p>Professor Evans is an Officer of the Order of Canada and a Fellow of the Royal Society of Canada and has a Doctorate Honoris Causa from the Universite de Montreal.</p>
          <p>Major publications include Strained Mercy: The Economics of Canadian Health Care (1984), Why Are Some People Healthy and Others Not? (1994) and An Undisciplined Economist (2016) edited by Barer et al., a collection of significant papers with commentaries by colleagues.</p>

He has carried on those studies as related to both the supply and demand sides of health services provided in Japan and other countries, including the supply and distribution of physicians, access to health care, cost studies on hospital care versus home care, establishing claim databases, and quality of care. These studies have been published in peer-reviewed journals in the fields of health policy, health services research, and general medicine. Through these integrated research activities, Dr Kobayashi seeks to examine the efficiency and equity of health care systems, and accordingly to suggest and advocate proper measures and better policies for improving the health of the people.</p>
